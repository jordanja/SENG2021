# SENG2021
## Theme: Camping Website

## NODE setup
To run the website now, Node.js is required. Install it if you don't have it.

Install npm if you don't have it, which is the Node package manager.
Install nodemon using `npm install -g nodemon`
Navigate to the /SENG2021 directory and run `nodemon` and access http://localhost:3000 to view the website.
Use Ctrl+C to close the app

If you guys have problems (steve advice)
ps aux | grep 3000
kill -9 "pid" (which node is occupied)
